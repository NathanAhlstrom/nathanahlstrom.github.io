<p>Desiring to streamline the CORAL GitHub repositories into on main CORAL repository. Found this very helpful postÂ <a title="Merging Two Git Repositories Into One Repository Without Losing File History" href="http://saintgimp.org/2013/01/22/merging-two-git-repositories-into-one-repository-without-losing-file-history/" target="_blank">http://saintgimp.org/2013/01/22/merging-two-git-repositories-into-one-repository-without-losing-file-history/</a></p>
<p>The recipe on this site includes an outline in Powershell to do the activities.  Nothing against powershell, but I'm a Linux user primarily.  So here is the recipe re-worked slightly to be CentOS 6.5 and BASH compatible.</p>
<p>ls -1 -I .git -I .gitignore -I management | xargs -n 1 -I f git mv f management</p>
