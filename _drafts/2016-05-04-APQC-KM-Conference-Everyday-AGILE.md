## Everyday Agile- How Everyday Agile Enhances the Flow of Knowledge | Rockwell Collins

_This is part of my summary series on the APQC Knowledge Management Conference 2016 that I attended in April 28-29th in Houston, TX_

This was an amazing talk!  Their title was very understated, "enhances" should be revolutionizes, sends into orbit, or re-creates...my two cents.

The main idea was [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "Agile on Wikipedia") in the context of knowledge management.  The cadence/heartbeat of the Agile "sprint" is extremely effective for driving KM into project teams and refining development processes.  Speaker Tim Wendt referred to the "sprint" and the associated practices as ["forcing functions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-shaping_constraint "forcing functions on Wikipedia - Behavior Shaping Contraints").
