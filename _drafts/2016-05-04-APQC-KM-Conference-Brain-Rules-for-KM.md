## Keynote Presentation: Brain Rules for KM by Dr. John Medina, Brain Scientist

_This is part of my summary series on the APQC Knowledge Management Conference 2016 that I attended in April 28-29th in Houston, TX_

Fascinating presentation, lots of helpful content here.  John Medina warned us that capturing notes during his talks is exceedingly difficult as he talks fast!  So I missed some concepts and I can't read the notes I did take!

_Key take-aways on engaging individuals while speaking to them:_
- We process meaning ahead of detail - so tell stories augmented with statistics, but not vice versa.
- Our attention span is 10 minutes, so at 9:59 tell a story, connect to meaning, etc. for the listener to get reconnected.
- C Factor - discussion of how to encourage high functioning teams: strong theory of mind (whatever that is?), **no interruptions**, and gender diversity on the team.

_Q&A had some fascinating discussion too:_
1. Someone asked about artificial intelligence: John's take was that there is no metaphor that compares to the brain.  Circuit board, processors, memory, etc. all fall short.  So AI is not a possibility without a mapping metaphor.
2. Someone asked about the effort in some states to legalize marijuana.  John's answer was striking, he said "go ahead if you hate teenagers".  Summary: pot causes irreversible damage to the teenage brain, not sure about adults older than 21 because there isn't any research.
