# **APQC KM Conference Summary**

I attended the [APQC KM Conference](https://www.apqc.org/apqcs-2016-knowledge-management-conference "APQC KM Conference") last week (April 28-29th 2016) in Houston.  It was a great conference.  

These are the few sessions I attended:

## Thursday

- Keynote Presentation: Brain Rules for KM by Dr. John Medina, Brain Scientist
- KM as a Force for Transformative Organizational Change | Pact
- Everyday Agile- How Everyday Agile Enhances the Flow of Knowledge | Rockwell Collins
- Capturing & Applying Lessons Learned within Your Organization | Nexen Energy
- Keynote Presentation (cont.): Brain Rules for KM by Dr. John Medina, 
Brain Scientist

## Friday

- Enterprise Social Creating Business Value Through Finding People | Medtronic

On Friday morning I was presenting the information on Finding People, unfortunately after presenting I had to dash off to catch a flight.

Here are some of my notes from the sessions I attended:

**Keynote Presentation: Brain Rules for KM by Dr. John Medina, Brain Scientist**

Fascinating presentation, lots of helpful content here.  John Medina warned us that capturing notes during his talks is exceedingly difficult as he talks fast!  So I missed some concepts and I can't read the notes I did take!

_Key take-aways on engaging individuals while speaking to them:_
- We process meaning ahead of detail - so tell stories augmented with statistics, but not vice versa.
- Our attention span is 10 minutes, so at 9:59 tell a story, connect to meaning, etc. for the listener to get reconnected.
- C Factor - discussion of how to encourage high functioning teams: strong theory of mind (whatever that is?), **no interruptions**, and gender diversity on the team.

_Q&A had some fascinating discussion too:_
1. Someone asked about artificial intelligence: John's take was that there is no metaphor that compares to the brain.  Circuit board, processors, memory, etc. all fall short.  So AI is not a possibility without a mapping metaphor.
2. Someone asked about the effort in some states to legalize marijuana.  John's answer was striking, he said "go ahead if you hate teenagers".  Summary: pot causes irreversible damage to the teenage brain, not sure about adults older than 21 because there isn't any research.


**KM as a Force for Transformative Organizational Change | Pact**

Excellent primer on using Knowledge Management efforts as culture change initiative.  Large focus on social intranet for creating culture.  The five pillars of KM:

1. Support all departments to capture, harvest, and monetize critical knowledge and innovations
2. Build capacity of country programs to integrate KM methods and tools into their work
3. Manage and enhance Mosaic as Pact's KM and innovation platform
4. With IT, govern Pact's internal data and information systems for optimal performance and efficiency
5. Engage externally to share Pact's KM approaches and learn from others

Not technology/tool driven effort more than throwing a tool at the problem!

Their social intranet based on JIVE went viral through C-suite promotion and having a dedicated community manager.

The community manager encourages impactful activity through a variety of means:
- weekly email newsletter featuring people, communities, most active geography
- monthly info graphic
- yearly survey
- innovation campaigns and competitions

_My take-aways:_
- investigate lucidchart.com to build mindmap type views and more
- **change management should be a focus for every KM team**
- **Position KM where burning need exists and grow it from there - Carla O'Dell APQC, restated by speaker Sara Teitelman**
- Document current state and ideal future state at the same time


**Everyday Agile- How Everyday Agile Enhances the Flow of Knowledge | Rockwell Collins**

This was an amazing talk!  Their title was very understated, "enhances" should be revolutionizes, sends into orbit, or re-creates...my two cents.

The main idea was [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "Agile on Wikipedia") in the context of knowledge management.  The cadence/heartbeat of the Agile "sprint" is extremely effective for driving KM into project teams and refining development processes.  Speaker Tim Wendt referred to the "sprint" and the associated practices as ["forcing functions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-shaping_constraint "forcing functions on Wikipedia - Behavior Shaping Contraints").
