<p>The Pomodoro Technique is very beneficial to my workplace productivity!</p>
<p>I'm tempted to be lazy, surf the internet, do the "easy" jobs, but this time and work management technique has been a very helpful way to tackle the important goals first!</p>
<p>Basic Synopsis of Pomodoro:</p>
<ol>
<li>25 minutes of focused intense work on one task.</li>
<li>5 minutes of a break - not an email catchup break.  A walk and a coffee/tea refresh and even closing my eyes for five minutes.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>I learned of Pomodoro from John Sonmez, the author of the Simple Programmer several months ago.  <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/11/04/want-quit-job/">http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/11/04/want-quit-job/</a></p>
<p>Taking John's advice I read through the Pomodoro Technique Illustrated, found it to be extremely valuable and an easy read, very helpful for me in this season of life!</p>
<p>Currently the Pomodoro Technique Illustrated is on sale until tomorrow, details below.</p>
