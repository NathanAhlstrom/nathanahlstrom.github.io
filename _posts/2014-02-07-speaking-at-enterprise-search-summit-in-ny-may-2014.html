<p>I will be presenting at the Enterprise Search Summit!</p>
<p>Just found out that they accepted my proposal; I will be talking about Drupal and Apache SOLR and how they play into a wider enterprise search strategy.    I am very interested in the nuts and bolts, as you can see if you've read this blog, so my talk will get into some technical details.</p>
<p>Details:<br />
Enterprise Search Summit, May 13-14 2014 in New York City.<br />
