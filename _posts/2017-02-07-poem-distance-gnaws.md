# Distance Gnaws #
<pre class="poem" style="border:0;">
Distance gnaws as thoughts prowl
Strife drips from the teeth of folly
Fight back; "defend" pride yells from the
Recesses struggling to explode from the
Depths to breathe deeply escaping from
Watery clutches. Drown him.

Separation like a mile the heart feels at
Warp speed; arrows sail dripping with hot
Oil laser sharpened to cut and perforate
The match of Gehenna poised at luscious
Lips billows forth pollution and poison.

Pillows and rest become pyres and nails;
Communicate yells the grief-striken heart
Overcome with sorrow.  Death pleads the prophets
Yearning for the better country.  Passions
Battle within; external quarrels and conflicts
Spill blood, envy and din of battle are wars
Canvas.

Turning self to simmer through humility our
Only hope.  Repentance declares Truth and
Bridges distance with joy.
