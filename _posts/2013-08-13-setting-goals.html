<p>Wow, woke up this morning thinking about what I had publicly committed to on the first post of this blog...to post everyday...what was I thinking! That was a way too ambitious of a goal. Let's edit that...<del datetime="2013-08-13T16:08:31+00:00">daily</del> to weekly...it that attainable?</p>

<p>God is speaking to me about setting goals through several of the books in my current reading pile. Professional goals for my career, family goals, personal goals, etc.  I'm still working through this, so this is a progress report post.</p>
<p>Two books in particular have been very helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.titus2.com/keeping-our-childrens-hearts.html">Keeping Our Children's Hearts: Our Vital Priority</a> by Steve and Teri Maxwell - chapter four of this book is about setting and communicating biblical goals to your family.</li>
<li><a href="http://bobpozen.com/">Extreme Productivity</a> by Bob Pozen - this whole book is around the subject of setting goals.  Bob advocates for setting year-long goals instead of 20 year life plan goals.  This has been helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you set goals for yourself? How do you know what to do?  Let me know in the comments below.</p>
