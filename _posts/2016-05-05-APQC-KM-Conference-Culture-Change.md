## KM as a Force for Transformative Organizational Change | Pact

_This is part of my summary series on the APQC Knowledge Management Conference 2016 that I attended in April 28-29th in Houston, TX_

Excellent primer on using Knowledge Management efforts as culture change initiative.  Large focus on social intranet for creating culture.  The five pillars of KM:

1. Support all departments to capture, harvest, and monetize critical knowledge and innovations
2. Build capacity of country programs to integrate KM methods and tools into their work
3. Manage and enhance Mosaic as Pact's KM and innovation platform
4. With IT, govern Pact's internal data and information systems for optimal performance and efficiency
5. Engage externally to share Pact's KM approaches and learn from others

Not technology/tool driven effort more than throwing a tool at the problem!

Their social intranet based on JIVE went viral through C-suite promotion and having a dedicated community manager.

The community manager encourages impactful activity through a variety of means:
- weekly email newsletter featuring people, communities, most active geography
- monthly info graphic
- yearly survey
- innovation campaigns and competitions

Bottom Line on social intranet success: promote, communicate, engage.

_My take-aways:_
<ul>
<li>investigate lucidchart.com to build mindmap type views and more</li>
<li>change management should be a focus for every KM team</li>
<li>"Position KM where burning need exists and grow it from there" - Carla O'Dell APQC, restated by speaker Sara Teitelman</li>
<li>Document current state and ideal future state at the same time</li>
</ul>
