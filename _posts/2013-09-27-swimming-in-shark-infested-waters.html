<p>Using the web, even for mundane uses like email, is like a swim in shark infested waters for a variety of reasons and even because of the advertising on these sites.</p>
<p>The ads are distracting at best, pornographic at worst.</p>
<p>For the Christian we need to have our eyes fixed on the Son of God (Colossians 3:1-2) and concerned about our heart motives related to our internet usage.</p>
<p>Installing an Ad blocking browser extension for the Firefox web browser can be very helpful.  Here is how to get it working:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Firefox from <a title="firefox.com" href="https://www.firefox.com/" target="_blank">firefox.com</a></li>
<li>Optionally set Firefox as your default browser.  [Note: it will bug you to do this, say No if you don't want it to be the default and tell it to not ask again.]</li>
<li>Install AdBlock Edge from <a title="AdBlock Edge" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-edge/" target="_blank">the Firefox Add-ons Page</a> (See image below)<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147" alt="AdBlock Edge Install" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/abe-install.png" width="750" height="193" /></li>
<li>Restart Firefox.</li>
<li>You will see the AdBlock Edge first run page.  It is safe to close this tab on your browser.</li>
<li>You are all set to be ad-free.</li>
</ol>
<p>This solution can be a helpful tool in the toolbox, but more than another tool we all need our hearts to be changed from pursuing sin to loving Jesus.</p>
<blockquote><p>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. <a title="1 Cor 6:9-11" href="http://www.esvbible.org/1+Corinthians+6.9-11/">1 Corinthians 6:9-11 ESV</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There is new life available in Jesus the Son of God who died on the cross for sins, trust in Him today and experience grace and help from Him for real transformation in this area and every area of life.</p>
