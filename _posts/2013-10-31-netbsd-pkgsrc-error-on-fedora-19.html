<p>When trying to use the pkgsrc tool on Fedora 19 it gave me a few minor errors. See my previous post <a href="http://nathanahlstrom.wordpress.com/2013/08/20/netbsd-pkgsrc-on-rhel-6-4/">NetBSD pkgsrc on RHEL 6.4</a> for how-to set it up, etc.</p>
<p>I was trying to build apache22 and during the dependency resolution pkgsrc determined to build tnftp, which gave the following error:</p>
<pre># bmake all
ERROR: This package has set PKG_FAIL_REASON:
ERROR: No usable termcap library found on the system.
*** Error code 1

Stop.
bmake: stopped in /opt/pkgsrc/net/tnftp</pre>
<p>It was a quick work-around when I figured out which RPM to add.</p>
<pre># yum install ncurses-devel</pre>
<p>Next it hit another error when trying to build libtool.</p>
<pre>checking whether we are using the GNU C++ compiler... no
checking whether g++ accepts -g... no
checking dependency style of g++... none
checking how to run the C++ preprocessor... /lib/cpp
configure: error: in `/opt/pkgsrc/devel/libtool-base/work/libtool-2.4.2':
configure: error: C++ preprocessor "/lib/cpp" fails sanity check
See `config.log' for more details
*** Error code 1

Stop.
bmake: stopped in /opt/pkgsrc/devel/libtool-base
*** Error code 1

Stop.
bmake: stopped in /opt/pkgsrc/devel/libtool-base</pre>
<p>Another pretty easy work-around, with some help from the Fedora Q&amp;A site: https://ask.fedoraproject.org/question/28136/how-to-get-gcc-in-fedora-19/</p>
<pre># yum install gcc-c++</pre>
<p>That solved all the issues with trying to build apache22 from pkgsrc.</p>
<p>I use pkgsrc to build a separate LAMP installation outside of the default RPM's - so that I can add custom modules and tweak settings pre-compilation.</p>
<p>Anyone using pkgsrc on Linux - what success stories do you have to share?</p>
