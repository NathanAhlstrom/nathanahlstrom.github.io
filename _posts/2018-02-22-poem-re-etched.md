<pre class="poem" style="border:0;">

The sizzling arrows fly
Darkness changes the countenance of the sky.

Arrows etched with transgressions past
The enemy knows these arrows will land fast.

“Help!”, I cry.
The Spirit whispers inside

Corinthians 6 comes the reply
"Such were some you, tis true, but..."

O glorious conjunction
the Spirit lifts my eyes

"You were washed,
		sanctified,
			justified 
in the name of Jesus Christ."

The arrows deflect
My shield etched
With His redemption

</pre>
