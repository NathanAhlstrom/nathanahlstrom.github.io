<p>I use delicious.com instead of the built-in bookmarks on my browsers: IE8, Chrome, and Firefox. Why? So I can get back to those items I've saved. I have used delicious.com for years primarily in my own workstream to save bookmarks, not necessarily to publish those as part of the "social" offering of delicious.</p>
<p>This has all changed because of Buffer, IFTTT, and Twitter; it is now a powerful social tool for me.</p>
<p><strong>What are these tools?</strong></p>
<p>Buffer = A product for Twitter (and other social channels) to automatically schedule your posts and spread them out through the day/week/etc.</p>
<p>IFTTT = Pronounced like gift minus the "g". IFTTT stands for IF THIS THEN THAT. It is a workflow engine for the social internet.</p>
<blockquote><p>IFTTT (pronunciation:"ift" as in "gift") is a service that enables customers to connect channels (e.g., Facebook, Evernote, Weather, Dropbox, etc.) with personally created or publicly shared profiles known as "recipes".</p></blockquote>
<p>Delicious = is a social bookmarking web service for storing, sharing, and discovering web bookmarks.</p>
<p>So putting it all together, I use the delicious.com plugin for Firefox (my primary browser), tag pages, and those get picked up by IFTTT every 15 minutes and scheduled by Buffer toÂ post to Twitter throughout the day/week/etc.</p>
<p>How do you keep your social stream active and engage with your followers?</p>
