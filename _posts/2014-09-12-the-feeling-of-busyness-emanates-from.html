<h1><strong>Busy Times!!</strong></h1>
<p>What is with all the busyness?  I feel it too.  <em><strong>Why are we so busy!?!?</strong></em></p>
<p>Recently I've started to think it has a lot to do with my faithful sidekick...</p>
<p>He is so useful, convenient, and johnny-on-the-spot! But he is also a major distraction and doesn't bounce over joyfully to see you like some other distractions.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_194" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-194 size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/golden-retriever-dog-1364426710r9x.jpg?w=300" alt="golden retriever dog" width="300" height="292" /> http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=35696[/caption]</p>
<p>No, not this distraction, I'm talking about Mr. Smartphone.</p>
<p>The main things that distract me about Mr. Smartphone (and gadget-friends) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The notification light blinking on my Android phone is irresistible.</li>
<li>Having my phone in my pocket <em>at all</em> makes it a temptation to check frequently.</li>
<li>The red notification circle with a count on my iPad terrorizes me to read email, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2><em>What should we do about this Mr. Smartphone?</em></h2>
<p>Recently I've heard some ideas about reclaiming some of the smartphone distraction time. Several of these have helped me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable notifications on every application on my phone, both the blinking light and the status bar.<img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/iconic_notification.png" alt="status bar" width="280" height="120" /></li>
<li>Leave my phone plugged in AND away from its usual sidekick location.  After work, I leave my phone in the kitchen and NOT in my pocket; to spend that time undistracted.</li>
<li>Turn off the phone entirely after work.  (I haven't done this yet)</li>
<li>Schedule in a check my email segment of time after dinner or before bedtime.  Have the conversation with your family and make it okay to have five minutes at a designated time to check in.  Knowing you have this time <em>later</em> will help you stay in the moment.</li>
<li>On my iPad, I haven't found a way to turn off those notification badges...they still terrorize me.  My solution is to not use the iPad.  It sits in the drawer!</li>
</ol>
<p>What about you?  How do you get undistracted time with your family and friends?  How do you keep your smartphone from distracting you?</p>
