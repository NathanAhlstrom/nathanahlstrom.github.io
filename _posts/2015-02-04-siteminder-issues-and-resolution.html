<p>In my workplace, we are using a product called CA SiteMinder.Â  On one half of a web server cluster it was failing hard!<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>Created a simple HTML file by this command:</p>
<p>echo "hi" &gt; index1.html</p>
<p>Running a simple HTTP request to that file failed. What did the log files reveal...nada! Chased <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/red%20herring">red-herrings</a> with NIS, network issues, etc.</p>
<p>Enabling SiteMinder logging didn't especially help much...could see a bunch of shared memory and semaphore activities.</p>

<p>Having some significant history with SiteMinder and Apache was helpful, but I was at a dead-end here. I tried network, file permissions, NIS issues, web server config review, SiteMinder config review.</p>
<blockquote><p>Time to pray!</p></blockquote>
<p>I can't say the answer came right away...probably within 24 hours and pushing on the doors I knew about, but I believe God did answer this prayer. Some might say, "God answering prayer about something so trivial? C'mon man." God does answer prayer and blesses His people who trust in Him through Jesus' death on the cross for sin.</p>
<p>After praying I began to investigate the shared memory system on the Linux box.</p>
<p><code><br />
# ipcs</code></p>

<p>After removing all the Semaphores and restarting Apache everything began working again! SiteMinder was choking on these semaphores.</p>
<p>A server reboot would have also solved the issue.</p>
